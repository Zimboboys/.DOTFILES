# .files

this repo holds my personal dotfiles for safekeeping and easy installations.
feel free to use or critique my choices.

## installation

installations have been automated using `Makefile`. these commands assume you
are working with a clean machine, so they may be desctructive to past configs.
run at your own risk.

**instructions**
first, clone the repo and move to the directory. then, choose a command.

    git clone https://github.com/Zimboboys/.DOTFILES.git
    cd .DOTFILES

**commands**:
- vim: `make vim`

## note about some of the files

my setup uses a few plugins which may be included here for completeness and
easy installs (and that i've yet to automate this). future plans remove these
from version control to make the setup _fancier_.
