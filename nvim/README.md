# `nvim`

settings for the terminal editor. note: `alias vim="nvim"`

## requisites

for a successful install, make sure the following is true:

* [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation) is installed
* `:PackerSync` is run from the editor after `./nvim.sh setup`, then a restart
* this .DOTFILES repo is not moved (lest a symbolic link break)
